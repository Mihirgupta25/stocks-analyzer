## Key Metrics Explained

### P/E Ratio
- **What it is**: Price per share divided by earnings per share
- **Interpretation**: Lower ratios may indicate undervalued stocks
- **Formula**: Market Price / Earnings Per Share

### Sharpe Ratio
- **What it is**: Risk-adjusted return measure
- **Interpretation**: Higher ratios indicate better risk-adjusted returns
- **Formula**: (Return - Risk Free Rate) / Standard Deviation

### Dividend Yield
- **What it is**: Annual dividend as percentage of stock price
- **Interpretation**: Higher yields provide income but may indicate risk
- **Formula**: (Annual Dividend / Stock Price) Ã— 100

## Diversification Strategy

The application uses an **equal weight allocation** strategy:

- **Equal Distribution**: Each selected stock receives equal portfolio allocation
- **Risk Reduction**: Spreading investments across multiple stocks reduces individual stock risk
- **Sector Balance**: Diversification across different sectors and industries
- **Rebalancing**: Equal weights help maintain portfolio balance over time

## Growth Projection Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gathers 2 years of historical price data
2. **Linear Regression**: Fits a linear model to price trends
3. **Projection**: Extends the trend line for user-specified months
4. **Calculation**: Computes growth percentages and monthly rates

**Note**: Projections are based on historical trends and should not be considered as financial advice.
